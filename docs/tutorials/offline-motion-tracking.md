This tutorial uses the root project tracking policy with an offline motion clip.

## Sim2Sim

Start the MuJoCo execution process:

```bash
uv run sim2real/sim_env/base_sim.py --robot g1
```

In a second terminal, start the tracking policy:

```bash
uv run sim2real/rl_policy/tracking.py \
  --robot g1 \
  --policy_config checkpoints/lafan-aa/policy-ec592bb4_lafan_100style_student-5000.yaml
```

Process roles:

- `sim2real/sim_env/base_sim.py` executes `low_cmd` in MuJoCo and publishes `low_state`.
- `sim2real/rl_policy/tracking.py` consumes `low_state`, runs the exported policy, and publishes the next `low_cmd`.

After both processes are up, press `]` in the policy terminal to start, then press `9` in the MuJoCo viewer to disable the virtual gantry.

## Integrated Sim2Sim

Use the integrated runner when the policy and MuJoCo should live in one process. It loads the policy immediately, sets the robot to the first frame of the motion, waits five seconds, tracks until the motion ends, and then holds the last frame. Elastic band is disabled by default for this runner.

```bash
uv run sim2real/sim_env/integrated_sim2sim.py \
  --robot g1 \
  --policy_config checkpoints/sonic_groot_6k/policy-sonic-groot-006000.yaml \
  --motion_path ../any4hdmi/output/sonic/motions/240529/macarena_001__A545.npz
```

Add `--headless` for non-visual runs. In the MuJoCo viewer, pressing space after the final-frame hold resets the robot to the first frame and repeats the wait-track-hold sequence.

## Sim2Real

Replace the MuJoCo execution process with the real bridge:

```bash
uv run scripts/real_bridge.py
```

In a second terminal, run the same tracking policy:

```bash
uv run sim2real/rl_policy/tracking.py \
  --robot g1 \
  --policy_config checkpoints/lafan-aa/policy-ec592bb4_lafan_100style_student-5000.yaml
```

Process roles:

- `scripts/real_bridge.py` bridges Unitree DDS `low_state` / `low_cmd` to the shared ZMQ runtime.
- `sim2real/rl_policy/tracking.py` stays unchanged between sim2sim and sim2real.
